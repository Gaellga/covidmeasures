  "death_intro_1": "During the COVID crisis, it is probably good to remind everyone that COVID-19, as scary as it sounds, is only one of many causes of death. The graphs below show the COVID-19 death rate as incremental rather than the sole focus of the analysis. We are also providing an overview by age range which highlights the age effect of the virus compared to the usual death rates.",
  "death_intro_2": "We hope that this page can inform individuals on how COVID-19 has become a threat for themselves and their loved ones compared to all the other death causes that we normally face in our day-to-day life.",
  "death_graph_1_below": "COVID-19 is at this time in the top 5 causes of deaths worldwide. With around 7,000 daily deaths, COVID-19 represents an increase of about 5% of the total death rate. Since the beginning of the crisis, COVID-19 accounts for an increase of 0.5% of the total death rate and is part of the top 20 causes of death.",
  "death_graph_1_below_last_update": "Last update: 2020/04/20",
  "death_graph_2_below": "The distribution among age ranges demonstrates the bigger impact of the COVID-19 on the older population. Worldwide, the 60+ population accounts for 75% of the total deaths, versus 65% for other causes. This phenomenon is exacerbated in certain continents, such as Europe where the 60+ population accounts for 85% of the total COVID-19 deaths. In the case of Europe which has the highest life expectancy and a large older population, the 60+ population usually represents 88% of the total deaths which is 3% above the COVID-19 death rate.",

  "death_graph_3_below": "The graphs above illustrate clearly the disparities between continents in terms of death rate in general as well as COVID-19 death rates in particular. In continents like North America and Europe, we notice a significant acceleration of the COVID-19 deaths since the beginning of the crisis while they are (still) barely noticeable on other continents.
