  "school_intro_1": "In their fight against COVID-19, governments around the world have decided to close schools, universities, and other educational institutions as part of the largest shutdown ever recorded. They mainly intended to protect children from exposure to this deadly virus as well as reducing its spread among the population. We shouldn't overlook that these measures have many side effects including an unprecedented toll on children's education. The CovidMeasures Community is compiling information to help citizens better assess the pro's and con's of these measures as the crisis evolves.",
  "school_graph_1_below": "According to our count, two-thirds of the children population on the planet are (or have been) impacted by measures of the school closure. So far children have already missed on average 1 month of school without knowing clearly when it is going to end. Recent announcements in some countries suggest that it may last until the summer.",

  "school_graph_2_below": "With the above ratios, we aim to capture the current magnitude of the COVID-19 epidemics compare to the impacts of school closure measures on children education. We can notice large disparities between the continents where those measures were implemented preventively and those who are seeing a rapid spread of the epidemic. Nevertheless, a key takeaway is that the relative cost of education is high. In Europe, for every COVID-19 death, children have collectively not gone to school for 50,000 days which is equivalent to 1 child's entire education (N. Am. = 3 / Lat. Am. = 400 / Asia = 800 / Africa = 1300 / Oceania = 8). These figures should invite us to question the actual effectiveness of these measures and how long we can reasonably keep them in effect.",
