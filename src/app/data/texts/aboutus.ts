  "aboutus_intro_1_p1": "CovidMeasures website was born from the collaboration of regular citizens willing to better understand this unsettling episode of mankind. Tired of the continuous broadcasting of the same graphs and data points about the expansion of the epidemic on social media and mass media, we've decided to focus on an aspect mostly overlooked, but nonetheless critical of this crisis - government measures and their consequences. On this website, you'll find a comprehensive database curated by our community on the government measures and their every-day consequences on citizens, businesses and the environment.",
